Hello and welcome,

My name is Matthias, and I am one of the trainers at VOAWW.

Starting today you will begin to be assigned the essential trainings you are required to complete as a DSP. Attached to this message is a syllabus with the details and other expectations. In summary, you will be assigned up to 40 hours of course work to complete in the month of November. All online courses will be performed at www.dstrainings.com.

In the middle of each week a selection of trainings will become available and should be completed by the end of the next week.

Please review the syllabus, log in to the site and complete the pre-class activity sometime before next the end of the week. If you do not complete these three steps we will reach out to you and your supervisor to ensure no barriers to completion exist.
